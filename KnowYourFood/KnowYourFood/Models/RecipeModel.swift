        ingredients: "2 pounds radishes \n 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil\nGood pinch of salt\nFreshly cracked pepper\n3 ounces feta, crumbled\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon\n 1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley",
        direction: "Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Trim the tops and tails from the radishes (reserve the greens for another use), and cut the radishes into halves (or quarters if your radishes are exceptionally large).Toss the radishes with the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Place in a large baking dish and roast for 20 to 25 minutes.\n While the radishes are roasting, make the vinaigrette by placing all of the ingredients together in a bowl and whisking them together. Taste and add more salt or pepper if needed. Set aside. \n Once the radishes are cooked, allow them to cool for a few minutes before assembling the salad. \n Combine the roasted radishes and crumbled feta in a salad bowl, and toss with a tablespoon or two of the vinaigrette. Taste and toss with additional dressing as needed. Scatter the herbs over the salad and toss to combine. If your radishes are still warm, the herbs will wilt; this is fine. \n Serve warm or at room temperature. Leftovers will keep for a few days in the fridge.",
